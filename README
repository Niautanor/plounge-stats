This repository contains a comment gatherer and statistics generation daemon for
the /r/mlplounge subreddit. The statistics are available on
https://mlplounge.science/stats

Most of the ideas and some of the code are taken from
https://github.com/trambelus/plounge-db though I have cleand it up and improved
it in a few occasions (for one thing, it now tries to only request the comments
that it hasn't seen yet)

This repository also contains a systemd unit file that manages the comment
gathering daemon. It can be installed with `systemctl install
./plounge-watcher.service` (run from the git repository).

It also contains a systemd unit file for the stats generation that behaves
pretty much identically.

TODOS:
Set up a mail server and send me a mail if the daemon exits unexpectedly
http://northernlightlabs.com/systemd.status.mail.on.unit.failure seems to detail
how to do that
